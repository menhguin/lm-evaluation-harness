  - question: Given a Markov chain with transition matrix P = [[0.7, 0.3], [0.4, 0.6]], what is the probability of being in state 1 after 2 transitions, starting from state 1?
    target: To find P²[1,1], multiply P by itself. [[0.7²+0.3*0.4, 0.7*0.3+0.3*0.6], [0.4*0.7+0.6*0.4, 0.4*0.3+0.6²]]. First element is 0.61. The final answer is 0.61
  - question: In R³, find the angle in degrees between vectors v₁=(1,1,1) and v₂=(1,0,-1).
    target: Angle = arccos((v₁·v₂)/(|v₁|·|v₂|)). Here v₁·v₂ = 1+0-1 = 0, |v₁| = √3, |v₂| = √2. So θ = arccos(0/(√3·√2)) = 90. The final answer is 90
  - question: For the complex number z = 1 + i, what is |z⁸| (the modulus of z to the 8th power)?
    target: For a complex number, |z|² = a² + b². Here |z| = √(1² + 1²) = √2. For powers, |zⁿ| = |z|ⁿ. So |z⁸| = (√2)⁸ = 16. The final answer is 16
  - question: A 4×4 matrix has eigenvalues {2,2,-1,3}. What is its trace?
    target: The trace of a matrix equals the sum of its eigenvalues. Here we have 2+2+(-1)+3 = 6. The final answer is 6
  - question: What is the degree of the minimal polynomial of a 6×6 nilpotent matrix with Jordan blocks of sizes 3,2,1?
    target: The degree of minimal polynomial equals size of largest Jordan block. Largest block is 3×3. The final answer is 3
  - question: In a Hilbert space, vectors u and v have ‖u‖=3, ‖v‖=4, and ‖u-v‖=2. What is their inner product ⟨u,v⟩?
    target: By polarization identity, ⟨u,v⟩ = (‖u‖² + ‖v‖² - ‖u-v‖²)/2. Here (9 + 16 - 4)/2 = 21/2 = 10.5. The final answer is 10.5
  - question: A group G has 2 elements of order 2 and 12 elements of order 4. What is |G| (the order of G)?
    target: For a finite group, sum of elements of each order must equal group order. Here 1 (identity) + 2 + 12 = 15. The final answer is 15
  - question: For random variables X,Y with Var(X)=4, Var(Y)=9, and Cov(X,Y)=3, what is Var(2X-Y)?
    target: Var(aX+bY) = a²Var(X) + b²Var(Y) + 2abCov(X,Y). Here 4Var(X) + Var(Y) - 4Cov(X,Y) = 16 + 9 - 12 = 13. The final answer is 13
